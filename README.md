exe2bat reborn in exe2powershell for modern Windows

exe2powershell is used to convert any binary file (*.exe) to a BAT file.
The resulting BAT file contains only "echo" command and finally a powershell command to re-create the original binary file.

This kind of tool is usefull during pentesting when an auditor trigger a shell without any upload feature. With "echo" and "powershell" the auditor is able to "upload" any binary file on the targeted system.
